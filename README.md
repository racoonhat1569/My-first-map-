## Why did I build this?

I built this to show people the places I like to go after a long day. Im Also doing this so that people can go and enjoy these type of stuff. Its better for people to enjoy and be happy, than being a gatekeeper and selfish person.

## Spotlight
A piece from my code is the longitude and lattitude which is the negative and positive. So what I did was having to go into google and search for the places I added in my map. So specifically saying going into the google maps website search the specific location of the places I added. I copied the coordinates/ longituted and lattitude and added them to the code of the map points. Puttin the negative ones first and the positive ones at the end.
